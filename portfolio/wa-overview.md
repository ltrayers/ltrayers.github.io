# Web Accessibility
## What is Web Accessibility?
Make web pages accessible to users with disabilities, including:
* Visual
* Auditory
* Motor (Movement)
* Cognitive
## What Needs to be Accessible?
Everything! That includes webpages, PDFs, Word documents, images, videos, MP3s, interactive games, etc. If it is on the internet, it should be accessible.
## What Makes Web Content Accessible?
There is a lot that goes into making a web page accessible. Some things need to be completed by developers and others by content authors. Here are some points CQ5 authors should keep in mind.
When needed, a user should be able to:
* **Make Content Accessible to a Screen Reader.**
Blind and visually impaired users will listen to a webpage instead of viewing it. Content must be correctly formatted so the screen reader can interpret and announce content for the listener.
* **Access Content In Images, Audio, and Video.**
Images, audio, and video should have a text equivalent whenever possible.
* **Allow Users to Adjust Layout and Colors.**
Users with disabilities may turn off all the colors, fonts, graphics, and designs to make a web page easier to access. They may enlarge font sizes, change font colors, remove background images, etc., to make content easier to read.
* **Navigate Web Pages with a Keyboard, Not Just a Mouse.**
Some users with physical disabilities can’t use a mouse. Also, many people view web content on smartphones and tablets where a touch screen is used instead of a mouse.
## Other Benefits
* **Improved Compatibility.** Accessibility supports access across different mobile devices and web browsers.
* **Future-proof Your Content.** Accessible content is more likely to be comparable with future technologies.
* **Improve SEO Performance.** Search Engines and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) use most of the same techniques to search for keywords.
* **Better User Experience (UX).** Accessible design is more user-friendly and benefits all users, not just people with disabilities.
## How to Make Your Webpages More Accessible
### Add Alt Text to Images
Screen readers can’t read the information inside an image; alt text is used instead.
#### Is Alt Text Needed?
* **Is the image also a link?**

  **Yes.** The image MUST have alt text. Treat the alt text as if it was a text link.
* **Does the image have information not provided as text anywhere else on the page?**

  **Yes.** Alt text should be a text version of the missing information.
* **Is the image a chart, graph, diagram, figure, etc.?**

  **Yes.** Briefly explain why the chart is important. Include a caption with more information, if needed.
* **Does the image contribute important information about the subject matter?**

  **Yes.** Explain what is going on in the image and why it is important.
* **Does the image only contain text?**

  **Yes.** Replicate the text in the image.
* **Is the image decorative?**

  **No.** If the image provides no meaningful content and is only there to make the page look nice.
* **Does the image have a caption?**

  **Maybe.** If the text for the image caption is the same as the alt text, do not include the alt text.
#### Alt Text Writing Best Practices.
* **Recommended character length:** Between 100 to 150 characters.
* **Don’t say it is an image:** Don’t use, “Image of…” or “Picture of…” the screen reader will do that for you.
### Use Text Instead of Images
Don’t place important information in an image; use regular text instead. It is okay to use images for promos and banners, but make sure the information is not essential content or messaging.
### Don’t Skip Headings
Think of headings as an outline or a table of contents for the page. Screen readers use headings as a form of navigation. Headings should include keywords from the main topics in the page.
*	Only use one Heading 1 per page and place it near the top of the page.
*	Do not use bold to mimic a heading.
### Use Bold, Italic, and All Caps Sparingly
Don’t format entire paragraphs with bold, italics, or all caps; it makes the text difficult to read.
*	**Bold:** For emphasis.
Do not use bold to mimic a heading.
* **Italics:** For styling book titles, magazine titles, and other citations.
* **All Caps:** Use all caps for acronyms. In online formats, all caps communicated anger and shouting.
### Write Meaningful Link Text
Write descriptive links that make sense even if they are not read within a sentence.
*	Screen reader users can navigate from link to link instead of listening to the whole page.
*	Avoid using generic statements like “more,” “read more,” and “learn more.”
### Don’t Rely on Color, Size, Shape, or Location to Convey Meaning
A screen reader can’t tell where content is placed on a page. It can't tell the color or the shape of text or images.
* Don’t use phrases like: “click the image above,” “see the image on the right,” or “click the red button.”
* View the page in mobile view. This view is similar to what a screen reader reads. Make sure the page makes sense when read from top to bottom.
### Keep Tables Simple
Tables are for tabular data and for organizing text into related categories.
*	Use as few columns and rows as possible.
*	Break larger tables into smaller tables when appropriate.
*	Don’t place images in a table.
### Add Column or Row Headers to Tables 
Column and row headers help both sighted and blind users understand how content is organized in a table.
*	The first row and column of a table must be formatted with header cells.
*	Do not use header cells to highlight or decorate individual cells.
### Add a Table Caption
A Table caption is like assigning a specific title to a specific table. This way, if there is more than one table on a page, they each have a unique title.
### Do Not Use “Autoplay” with Audio or Video
When a video or mp3 plays automatically, it interferes with the screen reader. Always provide pause/stop button for video that plays longer than five seconds and audio that plays longer than three seconds.
### Add Transcripts or Captions
Users with vision or hearing impairments may access transcripts (text version) or captions (text placed in the video) to access audio and video content.
*	**Audio:** Provide a transcript; an HTML page is the most accessible.
*	**Video:** Use captions; Vimeo and YouTube have captioning. Provide a transcript;an HTML page is the most accessible.
Creating a transcript:
*	If you have a script, start with that. Make edits as needed.
*	If the recording is of a live event or a webinar, work with your video vendor to create transcripts from the recordings.
