# Image Guidelines
**Status:** Retired. Published initially 05.13.2008 for American Chemical Society, Web Strategy and Operations.

Just as sentences and paragraphs must be carefully crafted and edited to express a particular message, images should also be considered. While it takes some time for the end user to read and comprehend the text on a web page, it only takes a few seconds for an image to make the same impact. 
* Good-quality images help build trust and make a professional impression. 
* Low-quality images reduce the credibility of your content and the ACS website.

Use clear, good-quality images that look professional to communicate trust and establish our credibility with the end user. If a good-quality image is unavailable, it is best not to use one.
## How to Choose an Image 
* Images should clearly relate to the subject matter on a page. They should help tell the story or represent a specific item or person referenced in the article. 
* When posting an image of a well-known personality, scientist, government official, or ACS employee, contact them directly or their press office and ask for a professional headshot. 
* Closely review all details in the image; make sure there are no offensive poses or gestures. 
* Be considerate of the people you photograph; do not post a "bad" picture of someone. (Think of how you would feel if a leading professional organization took a snapshot of you just as you scratched your nose?) 
* Large images are not always the best choice; they can overpower your content. Images should support content, not compete with it. Also, they take longer to download. 
* Less is more. One or two good-quality images will make a better impression on the user. Too many images, especially with different widths and sizes, will create a cluttered page that is difficult to read. 
* Use simple images with a clear subject and not overly detailed. Most small details will be lost when the image is compressed. 
## High-resolution versus Low-resolution Images
Image quality is measured in dots per inch (dpi).
* High-resolution images have a resolution of 300 dpi or 600 dpi. Use high-resolution images for print publishing.
* Low-resolution images have a resolution of 72 dpi or 96 dpi. Use low-resolution images for websites.
## Image Compression
Image compression is editing a high-resolution to reduce the file size. The result is a low-resolution file you can use on a webpage. The low resolution does not mean your image will look bad. 

All images will lose some quality during the editing process. 
* Start with a high-quality image, like 300 dpi, and you may not notice the loss of quality. 
* Start with a low-quality image, like 72 dpi, and the loss of quality is more noticeable.
### How to Compress an Image
Save your file with the following settings:
* **File type:** JPG or PNG.
* **Resolution:** 72dpi.
* **Width:** 1000 pixels or smaller.
* **File size:** As small as possible. 100 KB is considered large.

Compressed images usually can't be edited again. The image will continue to lose quality. 
## Image Editing Guidelines 
* Don't use **pixilated** images. This happens when you try to edit an image that is already compressed.

* Don't use **blurry** images. This happens when your camera is out of focus when you take a photo.

* Don't **enlarge** images beyond 100%. Images that are enlarged beyond 100% will become blurry or pixilated.

* Don't use **distorted** images. This happens when you adjust only the image height or width. Most image editors have a "lock ratio" option with their resize settings.

* Don't use **grainy** images. This happens when you take a photo in low light.
* Avoid **crooked** Images. Most image editors can rotate an image angle to align the image content horizontally or vertically. 
* Remove **red eye.** Most photo editing software has this feature.
