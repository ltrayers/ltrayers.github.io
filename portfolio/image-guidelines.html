<h1>Image Guidelines</h1>
<b>Status:</b> Retired. Published initially 05.13.2008 for American Chemical Society, Web Strategy and Operations.

Just as sentences and paragraphs must be carefully crafted and edited to express a particular message, images should also be considered. While it takes some time for the end user to read and comprehend the text on a web page, it only takes a few seconds for an image to make the same impact. 
<ul>
<li>Good-quality images help build trust and make a professional impression.</li> 
<li>Low-quality images reduce the credibility of your content and the ACS website.</li>
</ul>

Use clear, good-quality images that look professional to communicate trust and establish our credibility with the end user. If a good-quality image is unavailable, it is best not to use one.
## How to Choose an Image 
<ul>
<li>Images should clearly relate to the subject matter on a page. They should help tell the story or represent a specific item or person referenced in the article.</li> 
<li>When posting an image of a well-known personality, scientist, government official, or ACS employee, contact them directly or their press office and ask for a professional headshot.</li> 
<li>Closely review all details in the image; make sure there are no offensive poses or gestures.</li> 
<li>Be considerate of the people you photograph; do not post a "bad" picture of someone. (Think of how you would feel if a leading professional organization took a snapshot of you just as you scratched your nose?)</li> 
<li>Large images are not always the best choice; they can overpower your content. Images should support content, not compete with it. Also, they take longer to download.</li> 
<li>Less is more. One or two good-quality images will make a better impression on the user. Too many images, especially with different widths and sizes, will create a cluttered page that is difficult to read.</li>
<li>Use simple images with a clear subject and not overly detailed. Most small details will be lost when the image is compressed.</li>
</ul>
## High-resolution versus Low-resolution Images
Image quality is measured in dots per inch (dpi).
<ul>
<li>High-resolution images have a resolution of 300 dpi or 600 dpi. Use high-resolution images for print publishing.</li>
<li>Low-resolution images have a resolution of 72 dpi or 96 dpi. Use low-resolution images for websites.</li>
</ul>
## Image Compression
Image compression is editing a high-resolution to reduce the file size. The result is a low-resolution file you can use on a webpage. The low resolution does not mean your image will look bad. 

All images will lose some quality during the editing process.
<ul>
<li>Start with a high-quality image, like 300 dpi, and you may not notice the loss of quality. </li>
<li>Start with a low-quality image, like 72 dpi, and the loss of quality is more noticeable.</li>
</ul>
### How to Compress an Image
Save your file with the following settings:
<ul>
<li><b>File type:</b> JPG or PNG.</li>
<li><b>Resolution:</b> 72dpi.</li>
<li><b>Width:</b> 1000 pixels or smaller.</li>
<li><b>File size:</b> As small as possible. 100 KB is considered large.</li>
</ul>

Compressed images usually can't be edited again. The image will continue to lose quality. 
## Image Editing Guidelines 
<ul>
<li>Don't use <b>pixilated</b> images. This happens when you try to edit an image that is already compressed.
  ![Non-pixilated example](https://github.com/ltrayers/ltrayers.github.io/blob/7df80eabc7580f85e6c1b5391be035b5ccaf81c4/portfolio/images/original.png)</li>
<li>Don't use <b>blurry</b> images. This happens when your camera is out of focus when you take a photo.
  ![Non-pixilated example](https://github.com/ltrayers/ltrayers.github.io/blob/7df80eabc7580f85e6c1b5391be035b5ccaf81c4/portfolio/images/original.png)</li>
<li>Don't <b>enlarge</b> images beyond 100%. Images that are enlarged beyond 100% will become blurry or pixilated.
    ![Non-pixilated example](https://github.com/ltrayers/ltrayers.github.io/blob/7df80eabc7580f85e6c1b5391be035b5ccaf81c4/portfolio/images/original.png)</li>
<li>Don't use <b>distorted</b> images. This happens when you adjust only the image height or width. Most image editors have a "lock ratio" option with their resize settings.
    ![Non-pixilated example](https://github.com/ltrayers/ltrayers.github.io/blob/7df80eabc7580f85e6c1b5391be035b5ccaf81c4/portfolio/images/original.png)</li>
<li>Don't use <b>grainy</b> images. This happens when you take a photo in low light.</li>
<li>Avoid <b>crooked</b> Images. Most image editors can rotate an image angle to align the image content horizontally or vertically. </li>
<li>Remove <b>red eye.</b> Most photo editing software has this feature.</li>
</ul>
